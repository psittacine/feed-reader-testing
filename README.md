## Project for Udacity's [Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001)

#### Project Overview

Use [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application that reads RSS feeds. These will test the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.

Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development". This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.

### Instructions:

To run the application, load `index.html` in a web browser, or view it live [here](https://psittacine.github.io/feed-reader-testing/).  The tests appear at the bottom of the page.
